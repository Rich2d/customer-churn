2. Analyze the distribution of numeric attributes (normal or other).



3. Which attributes do you think can be eliminated or included in the analysis?



4. Determine whether the dataset has an imbalanced class distribution (same proportion of records of different types or not).



5.  Determine whether you need to handle missing values or transform any attributes
